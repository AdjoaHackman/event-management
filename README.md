# Event Management

## Description: 
Build an event management system where users can create, browse, and RSVP to events. Implement features for event categorization, ticketing, and notifications. Use MongoDB for storing event details, user RSVPs, and notifications.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User Registration and Authentication
Registration:
Users can register by providing a unique email, username, and password.
Passwords must be hashed before storing in the database.
Email addresses must be validated and unique in the system.
Users will receive a confirmation email with a link to activate their account.
Login:
Registered users can log in using their email/username and password.
The system should provide an error message if the login details are incorrect.
Password Recovery:
Users can request a password reset via email.
The system should send a password reset link that expires after a set time.
2. Event Creation and Management
Create Event:
Authenticated users can create an event by providing details such as title, description, date, time, location, and capacity.
The system should validate that all required fields are filled.
The event should be saved in the database with a unique identifier.
Edit Event:
Event creators can edit event details at any time before the event starts.
Changes to the event should be reflected immediately in the system.
Delete Event:
Event creators can delete an event. Deleted events should not be visible to users but can be recovered by administrators if needed.
3. Event Browsing and Search
Browse Events:
Users can view a list of upcoming events, sorted by date or popularity.
The system should display key details for each event (title, date, location, brief description).
Search and Filter:
Users can search for events by keyword, category, location, or date range.
The system should return relevant results based on the search criteria.
Event Details Page:
Users can click on an event to view full details, including a description, location map, organizer details, and remaining capacity.
4. RSVP and Ticketing
RSVP:
Authenticated users can RSVP to an event. The system should track the number of RSVPs and limit it to the event's capacity.
Users can cancel their RSVP before the event begins.
Ticketing:
For paid events, users should be able to purchase tickets through the system.
The system should generate a unique ticket code for each purchase and send a confirmation email.
Payment processing should be handled securely.
5. Notifications and Reminders
Event Reminders:
Users who have RSVP’d to an event should receive email reminders 24 hours before the event starts.
RSVP Confirmation:
After RSVP’ing, users should receive a confirmation email with event details.
Event Updates:
If an event is updated (e.g., time or location change), all RSVPed users should be notified via email.
6. User Profile Management
Profile Management:
Users can view and update their profile information, including name, email, and password.
Users can view a list of events they have created or RSVP’d to.
Delete Account:
Users can delete their account, which should remove all personal data from the system.
7. Admin Panel
Event Moderation:
Admins can view, edit, or delete any event in the system.
User Management:
Admins can view a list of all users, with the ability to ban or delete accounts.
Reporting:
Admins can generate reports on event statistics, user engagement, and ticket sales.
8. Security and Data Integrity
Data Validation:
All user inputs must be validated to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.
Session Management:
User sessions should be managed securely, with timeouts for inactive sessions.
Data Backup:
The system should automatically back up data regularly to prevent loss in case of system failure.
9. Performance and Scalability
Performance:
The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
Scalability:
The architecture should support scaling up (more servers) or out (more powerful servers) as the number of users grows.
10. Testing and QA
Unit Testing:
All major functionalities should have unit tests to ensure they work as expected.
Integration Testing:
Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
The system should be tested by end-users to ensure it meets their needs and the acceptance criteria.
